# weather_app

- For this project, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
- When you enter your location, the temperatures will be displayed using Fahrenheit. To see in Celsius, just click the Celsius button. 
- The background images will change depending upon the weather description.

# Source of code 
 - [@Kenizaya](https://github.com/kenizaya/weather-app/blob/main/script.js) - I used this person's code but did some things differently such as adding different images according to the weather, fahrenheit to celsius conversion, changed wind to miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour.
