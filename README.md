# About

- For this project, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

- When you enter your location, the temperatures will be displayed using Fahrenheit. To see in Celsius, just click the Celsius button. 

- The background images will change depending upon the weather description.

# Live Site

- [Weather App](https://dazzling-gumdrop-6aed62.netlify.app)


# Source of code 

 - [@Kenizaya](https://github.com/kenizaya/weather-app/blob/main/script.js) - I used this person's code because it was easier for me to follow and understand.
 
 - I did some things differently such as adding different images according to the weather, fahrenheit to celsius conversion, changed wind to miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour.
